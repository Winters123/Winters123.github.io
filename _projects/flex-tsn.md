- **Memory Efficient**: Dramatically reduces on-chip storage requirements
- **Standard Compliant**: Compatible with IEEE 802.1Qbv TSN standards

## Applications

- Industrial automation networks
- Automotive Ethernet
- Aerospace systems

## Impact

- Core architecture integrated into Yinhe Hengxin TSN switching chip
- Supports domestic chip self-reliance
