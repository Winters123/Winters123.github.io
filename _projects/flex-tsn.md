**FlexTSN** is a flexible Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) switching model that addresses the conflict between deterministic scheduling and hardware overhead.

## Key Innovations

- **AIAO Primitive**: Any-In-Any-Out programmable scheduling primitive
- **Memory Efficient**: Dramatically reduces on-chip storage requirements
- **Standard Compliant**: Compatible with IEEE 802.1Qbv TSN standards

## Applications

- Industrial automation networks
- Automotive Ethernet
- Aerospace systems

## Impact

- Core architecture integrated into Yinhe Hengxin TSN switching chip
- Supports domestic chip self-reliance
