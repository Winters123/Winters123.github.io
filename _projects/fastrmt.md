**FastRMT** is the first open-source FPGA-level RMT (Reconfigurable Match-Action Table) architecture implementation, supporting 100Gbps line-rate processing with microsecond-level latency.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: 100Gbps line-rate packet processing
- **Low Latency**: Microsecond-level processing delay
- **Fully Programmable**: Supports custom packet processing pipelines
- **Open Source**: First open-source FPGA implementation of RMT architecture

## Impact

- Adopted by Xilinx OpenNIC, Maipu Smart NIC, and satellite switching chips
- Published in CCF-A journal *Journal of Computer Research and Development* (2024)
- Presented at NSDI 2022
