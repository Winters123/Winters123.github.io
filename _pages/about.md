I am an **Associate Professor** at the College of Computer, [National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. from NUDT in 2021, and my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from NUDT in 2015 and 2017, respectively. I was a visiting PhD student at Queen Mary University of London (happily with [Gianni Antichi](https://www.gianniantichi.com/)) in 2019-2020.

Over the years, most of my time has been devoted to **building systems and networks that solve real-world problems for our partners both in industry and institutions**. I believe that good research should not only push the boundaries of knowledge but also make a tangible impact on the world.

**I am always looking for self-motivated students who share my passion for systems and networking.** If you are interested in FPGAs and/or network systems, and you enjoy building real systems that work for others, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to drop me an email with your CV and a brief description of your research interests.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **high-performance and security networks and systems**, with emphasis on:

- **Programmable Data Planes**: High-speed programmable network systems, FPGA-based in-network processing
- **Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)**: Deterministic networking for industrial and automotive applications
- **Domain-Specific Networking (DSN)**: Customized network architectures for specific application domains, AI training networks

## Highlights

- **Publications**: 16+ papers in CCF-recommended venues (9 top-tier papers in CCF-A journals/conferences)
- **Patents**: 7+ granted national invention patents
- **Open Source**: Creator of FastRMT - the open-source FPGA-level RMT implementation for Menshen (NSDI22)
- **Teaching**: Published 1 textbooks, First Prize in C4 Network Technology Challenge (2023, 2024, 2025)
- **Awards**: Hunan Province Teaching Achievement Second Prize (2025), Future Network Innovation Competition Grand Prize (2023)

## News

- **[2026.02]** Paper "CacheParallel: Comprehensively Exploring Multi-level Acceleration for Diffusion Models" accepted to IEEE DAC 2026.
- **[2025.12]** Promoted to Associate Professor at NUDT.
- **[2025.06]** Paper "Memory-Efficient Packet Classification at High-Speed" accepted to IWQoS 2025.
- **[2025.06]** Paper "Megabits Down to Kilobits: Memory-Efficient Time-Aware Shaping for TSN" accepted to DAC 2025.
