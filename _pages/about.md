I am an **Associate Professor** at the [College of Computer](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/), [National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. in Cyberspace Security from NUDT in 2021, and my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from NUDT in 2015 and 2017, respectively. I was a visiting researcher at Queen Mary University of London in 2019-2020.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **high-performance and trustworthy networks**, with emphasis on:

- **Programmable Data Planes**: High-speed programmable network systems, FPGA-based network processing
- **Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)**: Deterministic networking for industrial and automotive applications
- **Domain-Specific Networking (DSN)**: Customized network architectures for specific application domains
- **Network Acceleration**: Hardware-software co-design for network processing acceleration

## Highlights

- **Publications**: 16+ papers in CCF-recommended venues (9 top-tier papers in CCF-A journals/conferences)
- **Awards**: SIGCOMM 2020 Distinguished Paper Award
- **Patents**: 7+ granted national invention patents
- **Open Source**: Creator of FastRMT - the first open-source FPGA-level RMT architecture implementation
- **Teaching**: Published 2 key textbooks, supervised students winning national competition awards
