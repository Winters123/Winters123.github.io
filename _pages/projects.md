### [FastRMT - High-Speed Programmable Data Plane](https://github.com/Winters123/FastRMT)

**First open-source FPGA-level RMT architecture implementation**

FastRMT is the first open-source FPGA-level RMT (Reconfigurable Match-Action Table) architecture implementation, supporting 100Gbps line-rate processing with microsecond-level latency.

**Key Features:**
- 100Gbps line-rate packet processing
- Microsecond-level processing delay
- Fully programmable pipelines
- Open source

**Impact:** Adopted by many interesting opensource projects like [Menshen](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi22/presentation/wang-tao).

### FlexTSN - Time-Sensitive Networking

**Flexible TSN switching model with programmable scheduling**

FlexTSN addresses the conflict between deterministic scheduling and hardware overhead in Time-Sensitive Networking.

**Key Innovations:**
- AIAO (Any-In-Any-Out) programmable scheduling primitive
- Memory-efficient design
- IEEE 802.1Qbv compliant

**Impact:** Core architecture integrated into Yinhe Hengxin I TSN switching chip.

### FAST Framework (IWQoS 2019)

**Hardware-software co-design network acceleration teaching platform**

FAST (FPGA-Accelerated Switching and Testing) is designed for both research and education in network systems.

**Adoption:**
- Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications
- University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
- Southeast University
- National University of Defense Technology

**Impact:** Supported research leading to publications in SIGCOMM, ToN, and other top venues.
