<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an <strong>Associate Professor</strong> at the College of Computer, <a href="https://english.nudt.edu.cn/">National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)</a>. I received my Ph.D. from NUDT in 2021. I was a visiting PhD student at Queen Mary University of London (happily with <a href="https://gianniantichi.github.io/">Gianni Antichi</a>) in 2019-2020.</p>

<p>Over the years, most of my time has been devoted to <strong>building systems and networks that solve real-world problems for our partners both in industry and institutions</strong>. I believe that good research should not only push the boundaries of knowledge but also make a tangible impact on the world.</p>

<p><strong>I am always looking for self-motivated students who share my passion for systems and networking.</strong> If you are interested in FPGAs and/or network systems, and you enjoy building real systems that work for others, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to drop me an email with your CV and a brief description of your research interests.</p>
